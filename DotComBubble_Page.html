                <p>The dot.com bubble was a stock market bubble caused by excessive speculation of Internet-related companies in the late 1990s, a period of massive growth in the use and adoption of the Internet.</p>
                <p>The dot com bubble started with start of companies like amazon and ebay.</p>
                <p>A short history lesson on Amazon and Ebay.
                On July 4th, 1994 Amazon was born.
                Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie open an online bookstore in Seattle because of the city's reputation as a tech hub and because Washington's small population meant that they wouldn't have to charge sales taxes to most of their customer base. Bezos finances the company with $10,000 from his own pocket. They worked out of their own garage with a small staff.
                Similarly, AuctionWeb was born on September 1995, Pierre Omidyar was the person behind the auction website. Initially it was known as AuctionWeb, it was renamed to Ebay in 1997.
                </p>
                <p>Down the line there were lot of innovation that took place which enabled highly secure transactions between seller and customers.
                And also, with the raise in personal computers in households the shopping online grew rapidly.
                At the height of the boom, it was possible for a promising dot-com company to become a public company via an IPO and raise a substantial amount of money even if it had never made a profit—or, in some cases, realized any material revenue. People who received employee stock options became instant paper millionaires when their companies executed IPOs.On the whole, in the mid- to late-’90s, society’s expectations of what the Internet could offer were unrealistic. From individual dreamers to major corporations, Internet entrepreneurs were enamored with dreams of becoming dot-com millionaires (or billionaires). By and large, these entrepreneurs were inspired by companies like Amazon, eBay, and Kozmo. Of course, for every company that grew to be a multi-million dollar business, hundreds of others failed.

                <p>The Nasdaq index peaked on March 10 of 2000. During this peak moment, many tech companies have placed massive sell orders which resulted in panic selling of stocks by many investors. Within few weeks, the stock market lost 10% of its value. The investment capital for these dot com companies has reduced drastically.By the end of 2001, most of the dot com companies which were publicly traded were shut, with all the investment capital lost.</p>
                <p>Factors that led to the Bubble Burst</p>
                <p>Analysts focused on metrics of individual software companies that had nothing to do with how they generated revenue or profits. For example, one theory is that the Internet bubble burst due to a preoccupation with the “network theory,” which stated the value of a network increased exponentially as the series of nodes (computers hosting the network) increased. Although this concept made sense, it neglected one of the most important aspects of valuing the network: the ability of the company to use the network to generate cash and produce profits for investors. </p>
                <p>Apart from focusing on unnecessary metrics, analysts used very high multipliers in their models and formulas for valuing Internet companies, which resulted in unrealistic and overly optimistic values. Although more conservative analysts disagreed, their recommendations were virtually drowned out by the overwhelming hype in the financial community around Internet stocks.

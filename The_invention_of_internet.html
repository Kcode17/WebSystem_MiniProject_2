            <h3>How it started?</h3>
            <p>Unlike technologies like the light bulb or the telephone, the internet has no single “inventor.” Instead, it has evolved over a period of time. The internet got its start in the United States more than 50 years ago as a government weapon in the Cold War again soviet. For years, scientists and researchers used it to communicate and share data. Today, we are using the internet for almost everything, and for many people it would be impossible to imagine life without the internet.</p>

            <h3>The Sputnik Scare</h3>
            <img style='float:left;width:250px;height:260px; margin-right:10px;' src="images/nasa-1lfI7wkGWZ4-unsplash.jpg" />
            <p>On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world’s first manmade satellite into orbit. The satellite, known as Sputnik, It relayed blips and bleeps from its radio transmitters as it circled around the Earth. Still, to many Americans, the beach-ball-sized Sputnik was proof of something alarming.</p>
            <p>After Sputnik’s launch, many Americans began to think more seriously about science and technology. Schools added courses on subjects like chemistry, physics and calculus. Corporations took government grants and invested them in scientific research and development. And the federal government itself formed new agencies like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), to develop space-age technologies such as rockets, weapons and computers.</p>
            </br></br>
            <h3>The Birth of the ARPAnet</h3>
            <img style='float:left;width:250px;height:250px; margin-right:10px;' src="images/umberto-FewHpO4VC9Y-unsplash.jpg" />
            <p>Scientists and military experts were especially concerned about what might happen in the event of a Soviet attack on the nation’s telephone system which could destroy the whole network of lines and wires that made efficient long-distance communication possible.

In 1962, a scientist from M.I.T. and ARPA named J.C.R. Licklider proposed a solution to this problem: a “galactic network” of computers that could talk to one another. Such a network would enable government leaders to communicate even if the Soviets destroyed the telephone system.

In 1965, another M.I.T. scientist developed a way of sending information from one computer to another that he called “packet switching.” Packet switching breaks data down into blocks, or packets, before sending it to its destination. That way, each packet can take its own route from place to place.</p>
            </br></br></br>
            <h3>The Network Grows</h3>
            <img style='float:left;width:250px;height:250px; margin-right:10px;' src="images/jordan-harrison-40XgDxBfYXM-unsplash.jpg" width="20%" height="20%">
            <p>By the end of 1969, just four computers were connected to the ARPAnet, but the network grew steadily during the 1970s.


In 1971, it added the University of Hawaii’s ALOHAnet, and two years later it added networks at London’s University College and the Royal Radar Establishment in Norway. As packet-switched computer networks multiplied, however, it became more difficult for them to integrate into a single worldwide “internet.”
</br>
By the end of the 1970s, a computer scientist named Vinton Cerf had begun to solve this problem by developing a way for all of the computers to communicate with one another. He called his invention “Transmission Control Protocol,” or TCP.”</p>
            </br></br></br></br>
            <h3>The World Wide Web</h3>
            <img style='float:left;width:250px;height:310px; margin-right:10px;' src="images/pexels-ivan-samkov-4238506.jpg" width="20%" height="20%">
            <p>Cerf’s protocol transformed the internet into a worldwide network. Throughout the 1980s, researchers and scientists used it to send files and data from one computer to another. In 1991, a computer programmer in Switzerland named Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee created the Internet that we know today.

Since then, the internet has changed in many ways. In 1992, a group of students and researchers at the University of Illinois developed a sophisticated browser that they called Mosaic. Mosaic offered a user-friendly way to search the Web: It allowed users to see words and pictures on the same page for the first time and to navigate using scrollbars and clickable links.

That same year, Congress decided that the Web could be used for commercial purposes. As a result, companies of all kinds hurried to set up websites of their own, and e-commerce entrepreneurs began to use the internet to sell goods directly to customers. More recently, social networking sites like Facebook have become a popular way for people of all ages to stay connected.</p>

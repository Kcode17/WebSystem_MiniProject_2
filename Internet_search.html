            <h3>Building fast and building to last</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the new millennium, Google and Yahoo started down very different paths to attain the enormous scale that the growing size and demands of the Internet economy required. For Yahoo, the solution came in the form of NetApp filers, which has allowed the company to add more server space at a dizzying rate. Almost every service that Yahoo offered ultimately ran on NetApp’s purpose-built storage appliances, which were very quick to set up and easy to use, giving Yahoo a fast track to meet market demand.

But, Google began work on engineering its own software-defined infrastructure, known as the Google File System, which would function as a platform that could serve a large range of use cases for all the services Google would offer as a part of its future ecosystem. Instead of using the storage appliances as a foundation, the Google File System used commodity servers from others to support a flexible and resilient architecture that could solve scalability issues once and for all, simplifying and accelerating the future rollout of a wide range of web-scale applications, from maps to cloud storage.</p>

            <h3>Scaling complexity</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It took almost four years of ongoing development, and enormous amounts of engineering resources, before the Google File System reached a point where the company could use it for mission-critical operations. Meanwhile, Yahoo added NetApp filers almost immediately to keep up with growing demands for its services. In this race, it appeared Yahoo had pulled far ahead.</li>
    <li>Yahoo’s rapid approach also began to show some downsides. As demand increased and diversified, downsides to the appliance-based infrastructure emerged in the form of redundant engineering work, increasingly complex and inefficient environments and finally, mounting vendor costs. When Yahoo added a new service, it needed to re-engineer the NetApp platform for that specific use case.</li>
    <li>As a result, identical challenges for separate services, such as Yahoo Search and Yahoo Mail, had to be solved multiple times on different infrastructures. The infrastructure also exposed greater resource inefficiencies, as each use case required separate server space and compute power that couldn’t be shared across the platform. On top of that, the cost to run NetApp appliances grew as fast as Yahoo did, taking a significant amount out of the company’s revenue.</li>
    <li>Google built its file system in anticipation of these challenges, so that adding new use cases or fixing underlying architecture challenges could be done efficiently. After the purchase of YouTube, for example, Google could simply say, “throw away your back-end and we’ll put you on our platform.” Engineers could make upgrades to the underlying architecture once, and the solution would apply across all of Google’s services.</li>
